I created an interactive excel dashboard using pivot tables and charts with the objective of providing a dynamic and intuitive tool to analyze and visualize data across multiple dimensions.

## Pivot Tables: 
Utilized Excelâ€™s pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the dataset, enabling efficient data analysis and exploration.

## Interactive Dashboard: 
Developed an interactive dashboard that allows users to dynamically explore the data through five slicers. These slicers provide the flexibility to select different data columns for visualizations on the charts, empowering users to dive deep into the dataset based on their specific needs.

## Data Visualization: 
Designed visually appealing charts to represent key trends and patterns in the dataset.

## User-Friendly Experience: 
Ensured a user-friendly experience by implementing intuitive navigation and interaction within the dashboard. Users can filter and drill down into the data to gain a deeper understanding and uncover valuable insights.
